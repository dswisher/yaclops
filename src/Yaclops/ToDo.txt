- When printing list of options for a command, alphabetize them? (If so, by what - long id or short id?)
- Finish help for commands

- If resolving commands out of Autofac, how to pass in settings?

- Allow named parameters to be marked as required
- Allow mix-ins in addition to inheritence; if command object includes specially-attributed object, grab its props, too
- Handle enums and list of enums and more complex types, like FileInfo, TimeSpan and DateTime
- Add support for fields (in addition to properties)
- Add support for complex meta-rules (if -b is specified, field X is required or w/e - custom Func passed by user)
- If duplicate short/long names are specified at the SAME LEVEL, emit a warning
- Figure out a way to make description and other text dynamic. For example, to embed a const in a description
  or reference another parameter/command.
- Add "did you mean" support (try 'git comit' or 'git help -man')
